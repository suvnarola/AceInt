			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>The product ordering system was designed to assist
				E Banc Trade Licensees in obtaining E Banc
				Trade products and promotional literature.
				This second installment of the system was
				developed to fix the many problems that
				arose from the first system. This tutorial
				file was written to assist Licensees and
				Staff that are using the system. To navigate
				the different parts of this tutorial file,
				simply click the links in the bar above.
				If you would like to print this file out,
				click the Print icon at the top left of
				this page.</p>

		<div id="section_mainMenu" title="The Main Menu">
			<h3>Main Menu</h3>
			<p>The main menu is always present at the top of
				the product orders system, this is designed
				to be an easy way for you to navigate between
				past and present orders. There are three
				buttons in the main menu; &quot;View Past Orders&quot;,
				&quot;Current Order&quot; and &quot;User Manual&quot;. The
				&quot;View Past Orders&quot; button will bring up
				the past orders screen, for more information
				on this screen visit the <strong><a href="javascript:getSection('pastOrders')">Past
				Orders</a></strong> section
				of the manual. The &quot;Current Order&quot; button
				will bring up your current unsent order.
				The &quot;User Manual&quot; button will bring up
				this manual, do not hesitate to use this
				if you are ever stuck.</p>

			<h3>The order panel</h3>
			<p>The order panel (on the right) displays the order
				that you are currently modifying in summation
				form. To the left is a sample order panel,
				move your mouse over the different parts
				of the panel for a description.</p>
			<p>The panel
					is titled according to the order that
				you are modifying. For the example that
				we have, this is our current unsent order,
					and is thus titled <strong>&quot;Current Order&quot;</strong>.
				If we were modifying an order that we had
					sent, the order would be titled <strong>&quot;Order
				#<acronym title="Order Number"><em>[num]</em></acronym>&quot;</strong>.			</p>
			<p>Under the title, the name of the person
						that sent through the order is
				displayed. Eg. &quot;Josiah Truasheim&quot; is ordering
					this order.</p>
			<p>By clicking the print icon,
							you can print out your current
					order.</p>
			<p>The select box below this is where you can select
				where you would like the <strong>order
				to be delivered</strong>			to. To change this, simply click the down
				button to the right, than scroll to the
				area that you would like this delivered
				to (Areas are listed alphabetically).</p>
			<p>The products that you have ordered are displayed
				below the area select box. Each product
				will display the quantity that you have
				ordered (in bold), the name of the product,
				and the amount that you will be charged
				for that product. To make modifications
				to the quantity of a product, click the
				<strong>&quot;Change&quot;</strong> link. This will bring you the
				item's category, so that you can modify
				it. To remove a product from your order,
				click the &quot;<strong>Remove&quot;</strong> link.</p>
			<p>The <strong>total cost</strong> of the order is displayed after
				all the products.</p>
			<p>The status of your comments is displayed below
				the products and total. When the status
				says <strong>&quot;No Comments&quot;</strong>, this means that you
				have not added comments to your order.
				If the status says <strong>&quot;Comments
				Added&quot;</strong> than
				this indicates that you have added comments
				to your order. Below this is a link that
				will let you add/change the comments attached
				to the order.</p>
			<p>The <strong>&quot;Clear this order [X]&quot;</strong> link will remove the
				order that you are working on from the
				system. This is permanent, you will not
				be able to retrieve this order.</p>
			<p>The <strong>&quot;Send this order [&gt;&gt;]&quot;</strong> link will send your
				unsent order to Head Office for processing.
				This link will not appear if you are modifying
				an order that you have sent. This is because
				the order does not need to be sent again,
				Head Office will recieve any changes that
				you make.</p>
