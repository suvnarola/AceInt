		<div class="subComponents"><a name="2"></a><h3>Introduction</h3><p>This document is designed to give you an overview of how to use the html
newsletter format in an email client. This document only covers
Microsoft Outlook &amp; Microsoft Outlook Express. If you require
further assistance please contact E Banc Trade Head Office directly on
(+61) 7 5437 7220. This document was written as a step by step guide and

folders. <b>To&nbsp;do&nbsp;this:</b>

There are two different ways to install the html newsletter depending on
what Microsoft email client you are using.</p><a name="5"></a><h3>Installing for Microsoft Outlook</h3><p>Save or copy the html file that you received to
C:Documents&nbsp;and&nbsp;Settings<b><i>your&nbsp;name</i></b>Application&nbsp;DataMicrosoftStationery<br />
In <b>Microsoft Outlook</b> click
Actions&nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;New&nbsp;Mail&nbsp;Message&nbsp;Using&nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;More&nbsp;Stationary.
This will bring up a window displaying all the stationary that is
available. From this window you can select the stationary that you have
just saved to your computer. Click the ok button.</p><div class="subComponents"><a name="46"></a><h3>Opening your Newsletter or Bulletin Email Stationery</h3><p>In Microsoft Outlook<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>click&nbsp; &quot;Actions&quot; &raquo; &quot;New mail message using&quot; &raquo; &quot;More Stationary...&quot;. In the dialogue box that pops up, select the the file that you saved earlier. This will open a new email using your stationary.<br />
</p></div><a name="6"></a><h3>Installing for Microsoft Outlook Express</h3><p>Save or copy the html file that you received to My&nbsp;Documents/Email&nbsp;Stationary
Message&nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;New&nbsp;Message&nbsp;Using&nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;Select&nbsp;Stationary.

button.</p><div class="subComponents"><a name="10"></a><h3>Opening your Newsletter or Bulletin Email Stationery</h3><p>In <b>Outlook Express</b> click Message&nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;New&nbsp;Message&nbsp;Using&nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;Select&nbsp;Stationery.This will bring up a window that displays the compatible files from your computer.Navigate to My&nbsp;Documents/Email&nbsp;stationery and select the stationerythat you have just saved to your computer. Click the OK button.</p></div></div><a name="11"></a><h3>Using your html newsletter</h3><p>If you do not have the html newsletter template open, then open it by following
the procedure described above, choosing the instructions to match your email
client.</p><div class="subComponents"><a name="12"></a><h3>Editing text in a html newsletter</h3><p>  <p> The template you have received has preformatted text colours, fonts and
    styles within the bordered boxes where you will be typing or pasting your
    text. You can choose to change these to suit your preferences, by editing
    the text as you would normally do in any email. However there are certain
    guidelines that will ensure a well presented newsletter. We recommend that
    you use the font "Arial" as this is the font that complies with the E Banc
    Trade corporate image and you can be certain that all the computers you are
    emailing will have this font, meaning your email will display as you prepared
    it and not use a substitute font.. It is also a good idea to make sure that
    you use the same font size throughout the newsletter, unless for a heading,
    as this is much more visually pleasing. ALWAYS make sure that you use CAPS,
    <span style="color: red;"> Colours</span> and <b>bold</b> sparingly as an
    overuse of these can result in your newsletter being labelled as <acronym title="Unsolicited Email - This is illegal by Australian Law. Contact E&nbsp;Banc&nbsp;Trade Head Office for more information">SPAM.</acronym>
    Certain words such as free, and unsubscribe, also contribute to your email
    being regarded as SPAM.</p>
  <p>In
    an HTML email the line breaks (returns) will behave differently from the way
    they behave in a normal email message. To break into the next line (normal
    occurrence in a normal email when you press the "enter" key) you will need
    to hold the Shift key down while you press Enter at the same time. To have
    a paragraph return you simply need to press the Enter key. This will bring
    the cursor down two lines. </p></p><a name="13"></a><h3>Using Bordered boxes</h3><p>  <p> Using the bordered text boxes that are present in many publications is easier
    than it might first appear. It is a simple procedure of copying and pasting
    your text into the appropriate place. Each box has a header, a body and a
    contact section. You can add as many of these boxes as you need. To create
    a new box, right click on the <b>border</b> of the box you wish to copy. Select
    Copy from the box that displays.. Place your cursor where you would like the
    new box to appear, then, right click and select Paste. To create a space between
    boxes, simply place your cursor to the right of the text box above, then holding
    the Shift key down, hit the enter button on your keyboard. To remove a box,
    click the border of the box, then press the Delete key. </p></p><a name="14"></a><h3>Footer Message</h3><p>Remember to sign off using the Footer Message at the bottom of your email.
    Make sure you don't delete the 'Unsubscribe' or confidentiality message. These
    are necessary to comply with the SPAM Act.</p></div></div>
