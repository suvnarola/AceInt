		<div class="subComponents"><a name="1"></a><h3>Introduction</h3><p>This document is designed to assist you in communicating with large&nbsp;numbers of your Empire Trade membership via Email. Before you start to do this, you should read about <acronym title="Unsolicited Email">SPAM</acronym>. This document was written as a tutorial to guide you through the process step by step. The Best way to read this is from start to finish, following all instructions and taking note of the information presented.<br />
</p><a name="16"></a><h3>Spam</h3><p><p>One of the greatest issues facing digital communications these days is SPAM.&nbsp; Chances are that if you have been using email for a while, you will have received emails that you don't want or need.&nbsp; These emails are called spam. In most countries there is no law against this.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Australia however there are strict Anti-SPAM laws. We at Empire Trade fully comply with these laws and if you are sending out bulk emails you will need to as well.</p>
</p><div class="subComponents"><a name="18"></a><h3>Spam and Australian Law</h3><p><P>Information about Australian&nbsp;Privacy regulations are available from <A href="http://www.privacy.gov.au/act/privacyact/">http://www.privacy.gov.au/act/privacyact/</A></P>
<P>Information about Australian&nbsp;SPAM&nbsp;Act is available from the&nbsp;<A href="http://www.aca.gov.au" target=_blank>Australian Comunications Authority</A>&nbsp;website (see the link below).<BR><A href="http://www.aca.gov.au/consumer_info/spam/informationforbusiness.htm">http://www.aca.gov.au/consumer_info/spam/informationforbusiness.htm</A></P></p><a name="19"></a><h3>Privacy, Spam and Empire Trade</h3><p><p><!--StartFragment -->As part of our membership approval process, members of Empire Trade are protected by&nbsp;our Privacy Policy which includes information on how we deal with SPAM.&nbsp; This information is available from our corporate website. </p>
<p><!--StartFragment -->&nbsp;Our policy strictly prohibits unsolicited, commercial email (spam).&nbsp;<!--StartFragment --> Under no circumstances is a member's personal information to be&nbsp;disclosed to a third party without the approval of head office,&nbsp;and the consent of the member. To further comply with privacy regulations, the email addresses of members must not be displayed to other members when communicating with multiple email addresses.<!--StartFragment --></p>
<p>To comply with the SPAM Act, all emails to multiple recipients must include an unsubscribe&nbsp;paragraph, and must identify the sender's company, address and contact details (this information is included in your Empire Trade email stationery).&nbsp; In order to comply fully with the SPAM Act, all communication to Empire Trade members must be&nbsp;regarding Empire Trade business or member services.<br />

<p>No matter what your content is, you always need to put the following paragraph at the end of the email to comply with Australian spam law.</p>
