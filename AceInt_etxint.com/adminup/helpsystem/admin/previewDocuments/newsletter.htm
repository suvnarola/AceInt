		<div class="subComponents"><a name="120"></a><h3>Loading your newsletter to the corporate site</h3><p><p>Licensees and nominated staff can load their newsletters directly to the corporate website from this location. </p>
<p>It is important that you convert your newsletter to PDF using Acrobat before uploading. You will need to purchase the full version of Acrobat, or use one of the free programmes downloadable from the web. This will assist in keeping file sizes small, and allow all members to view the document. Programmes such as Word and Publisher are proprietary and cannot be viewed unless the reader has that same software and version.</p>
<p>Newsletters can be uploaded by clicking on 'Browse' after the 'File Upload' field and navigating to the location on the computer where the file is stored. Assign a display name to the file which should be the month and year of the publication, e.g. January 2004 in the case of monthly publications. If more than one newsletter is created in a given month then the date precedes the month and year e.g. 10 January 2004. </p>
<p>Next, select the date of the newsletter in the 'Order Date' field. This will ensure the newsletter links are displayed on the screen in the correct date order, from the most recent to the oldest. The licensed area for which the newsletter has been created must be selected, then the 'Upload' button is pressed to confirm the upload of the newsletter file. </p>
</p><a name="122"></a><h3>Making Revisions</h3><p><p>You can also correct errors on previously uploaded files by first deleting them, then reloading the correct file. Click on the space beside the file name you wish to delete. The selected file will be highlighted by a dark grey. You can select multiple files, or delete them individually. Once all files you wish to delete have been selected, make the button beside 'Delete Selected Files' at the bottom left of the page, then complete the process by clicking on the 'Delete' button on the bottom right of the page.</p>
<p>Now load the correct files. It is a good idea to retain past newsletters so members can look back over services and specials that have been offered in the past. This will also be a good marketing tool for prospective members.</p>
